## Installation Requirements

* libfile-which-perl
* storcli

## Requirements for Icinga/Nagios

* On the system to be monitored:
  * check_lsi_raid plugin
  * storcli
  * sudoers entry for user nagios and storcli
   (example: nagios ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/storcli)
* NRPE (optional): command definition
* On the Icinga-server:
  * command definition
  * service definition

## Installation hints for CentOS

* It is possible that the NRPE daemon runs as user 'nrpe'. If that's the case
  you have to change the user in the sudoers entry.
* It may be necessary to specify the perl interpreter explicitly in the NRPE
  command definition, e.g.:
  command[check_lsi_raid]=/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_lsi_raid -C 0 -p /usr/sbin/storcli
* On newer CentOS/RedHat systems problems with sudo/SELinux might occur. In order to run the plugin
  as root the following sudoers options might help:
  Defaults:nrpe !requiretty

./check_lsi_raid -Tw 40 -Tc 50 -LD 0,1 -PD 1 -b 0
